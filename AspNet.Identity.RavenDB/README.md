* AspNet.Identity.RavenDB
************************MK/

This is an adaption of RavenDB.AspNet.Identity,
originally created by ILM Services ans David Boike
	  https://github.com/ILMServices/RavenDB.AspNet.Identity

This package contains a little bit of refactoring, mainly separating classes, BUILD it, so it's nuget ready and a very little bit of code cleanup.
You may want to use
	AspNet.Identity.Owin
which is built on this package and provides a basic Identity.Owin bundle and takes care of the startup pattern used by OWIN.
